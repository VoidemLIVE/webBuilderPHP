# PHP Webpage Builder

An old project that i wanted to try and make in April earlier this year when i was doing a lot of PHP related things.
Today i decided to fix a problem i had with it, might update with more features, probably not though. 

Not made for any production purpose, just for practise.

(If hosting locally & on port 3000)

If you have not included a footer, you can remove the page by going to:
<br>
localhost:3000/delete.php?id=Website-Maker
<br>
Do not include the "DIR" when deleting a page
